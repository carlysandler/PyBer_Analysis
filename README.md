## Overview of Analysis
PyBer, the ride-sharing company, requested our expertise in data visualization to help them better improve access to ride-sharing services and determine the most appropriate and economically competitive fare prices for underserved neighborhoods. Specifically, when tasked with determining the correlation between city type and fare amount,  we must create a summary `DataFrame`, which will consisely visualize, in tabular form, how the data differs by city type, on key metrics that measure supply and demand for each city type. Once done with this deliverable, a line graph will be created from PyBer's 2019 ride-sharing data, plotting the relationship between city type and weekly fare amounts (USD$). This analysis will deliniaate the steps taken to complete the two Deliverable mandates, as well as business recommendations to PyBer on how to improve ride acccessibility, based on the results shown below. 

The key variables of interest are as followed. 

Firsly, our index variable: `type`. The three different city types in the US we are analysising are:

  __City Type__:
  - Urban
  - Suburban
  - Rural

Secondly, our column variables--the key "relational" metrics of interest, that differ by city type and will cross-analyzed for our data visualiation are:

  __Column Variables__
  - Total Rides 
  - Total Drivers
  - Total Fares
  - Average Fare per Ride
  - Average Fare per Driver
